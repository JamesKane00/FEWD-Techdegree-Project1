        Virtual reality is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there. It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal and is a technically complex feat that has to account for our perception and cognition. It has both entertainment and serious uses. The technology is becoming cheaper and more widespread. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work thanks to the possibilities of virtual reality. Oculus are pioneering the leading technologies in virtual environment creation. It will be interesting to see the impact this revolutionary new technology will have on such areas such as: Architecture, sports, medicine and education, as it has already had a tremendous impact on entertainment - specifically gaming.

        DeepMind is the world leader in artificial intelligence research and its application for positive impact. They’re on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be taught how.
        If they’re successful, they believe this will be one of the most important and widely beneficial scientific advances ever made, increasing their capacity to understand the mysteries of the universe and to tackle some of our most pressing real-world challenges.
        From climate change to the need for radically improved healthcare, too many problems suffer from painfully slow progress, their complexity overwhelming our ability to find solutions. With AI as a multiplier for human ingenuity, those solutions will come into reach.

          Infinity Ward, Inc. is an American video game developer. They developed the video game Call of Duty, along with six other installments in the Call of Duty series.
          Vince Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West established Infinity Ward in 2002 after working at 2015, Inc. previously. All of the 22 original team members of Infinity Ward came from the team that had worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault while at 2015, Inc.
          Activision helped fund Infinity Ward in its early days, buying up 30 percent of the company. The studio's first game, World War II shooter Call of Duty, was released on the PC in 2003. The day after the game was released, Activision snapped up the rest of Infinity Ward, signing employees to long term contracts.
          Infinity Ward went on to make Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Ghosts and most recently Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.
