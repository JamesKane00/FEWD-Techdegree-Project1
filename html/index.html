        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web-developer/entrepreneur. I am highly driven, ambitious and strive to master web development to the highest degree that I can and become en effective problem solver so that I may better serve the world. </p>
        <p>I have previously worked as a retail assistant and as a bartender but have always wanted to pursue a degree in the tech industry. I have some minor experience with Java but have decided that front-end web development is a much better starting point for me to achieve my goals.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building websites and applications, throughout my career in tech there are many technologies I want to become proficient in, of the many, some of these include:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to work for a fantastic web design company where I can not only hone my skills with the various technologies above but get some real-time experience working with clients and developing my ability to solve the problems of the client</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>There are a few hobbies that I engage in every day. I always get up at 05:30 every morning to run. I orginally became interest because of the physiological health benefits it entails but as I kept with my regimen I began to see the profound psychological effects continuous exercise has.</p>
        <p>I also engage in Meditation and Yoga every day. This has been, from my view, the deciding factor in my ability to turn my life into one of success and happiness. The mental clarity and well-being I have achieved from both the former and the latter has been amazing.</p>
        <p>I also love to write. Many subjects ranging from Eastern philosophy to nanotechnology interest me greatly and I always take time every night, usually right before going to sleep, to write about these subjects. I find that journalling in this way not only improves my communication skills both internally but also externally.</p>
